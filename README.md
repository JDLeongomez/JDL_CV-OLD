It is based on the `short_cv` created by [JooYoung Seo](https://github.com/jooyoungseo), using the the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package in R. For a description, please check his [CV repository](https://github.com/jooyoungseo/jy_CV). In addition, in the long versions of my CV (both English and Spanish), I use code to create a map of my academic journey, based on the one created by [Lorena Abad](https://github.com/loreabad6) in [her CV](https://github.com/loreabad6/R-CV).
